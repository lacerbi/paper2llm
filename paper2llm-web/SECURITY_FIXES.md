# Security Vulnerability Fixes

## Overview
Fixed multiple npm dependency vulnerabilities in the paper2llm application.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed

### Initial State
- 9 vulnerabilities total (3 moderate, 6 high)
- Main issues:
  - nth-check < 2.0.1 (high severity - RegEx complexity vulnerability)
  - postcss < 8.4.31 (moderate severity - line return parsing error)
  - webpack-dev-server <= 5.2.0 (moderate severity - source code exposure)

### Resolution Strategy
Used npm overrides in package.json to force secure versions:

```json
"overrides": {
  "nth-check": "^2.0.1",
  "postcss": "^8.4.31",
  "webpack-dev-server": "^4.15.2",
  "svgo": "^2.8.0",
  "resolve-url-loader": "^5.0.0"
}
```

### Current State
- Reduced to 3 moderate severity vulnerabilities
- These are related to webpack-dev-server v4.15.2 which still has some moderate issues
- Could not upgrade to v5+ due to react-scripts v5.0.1 compatibility issues
- The remaining vulnerabilities are in development dependencies only

## Trade-offs
- webpack-dev-server remains at v4.15.2 instead of v5+ due to react-scripts compatibility
- The moderate vulnerabilities are related to potential source code exposure in dev server
- These only affect development environment, not production builds

## Testing
- `npm run build` - Production build works correctly
- `npm start` - Dev server starts with deprecation warnings but functions properly
- No breaking changes to application functionality

## Recommendations
1. Consider upgrading to a newer React build toolchain (e.g., Vite) to avoid react-scripts limitations
2. Monitor for react-scripts updates that support webpack-dev-server v5+
3. The current state is acceptable for development as vulnerabilities are moderate and dev-only
